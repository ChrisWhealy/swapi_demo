# API into Cloned Star Wars Data

The <https://swapi.dev> website provides a wide variety of information about the Star Wars films.
This includes categories such as:

* People
* Planets
* Starships

This app exposes a simple JSON-based API into a local copy of the SWAPI data, and serves as an exercise in using declarative macros to generate repetitive code blocks.

## Execution

Clone this repo into a local folder then start the service using `cargo run`.

You can now access the data via <http://localhost:3000>
